# Nmap Network Scanning Tool (WebNmap)

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The Nmap Network Scanning Tool, also known as WebNmap, aims to provide a user-friendly web interface for executing Nmap commands and displaying scan results. It is designed to simplify network reconnaissance and security auditing tasks.

### Objectives
- Develop a responsive web UI using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
- Implement a backend server using Node.js and Express.js to handle Nmap commands securely.
- Utilize the `child_process` module in Node.js for executing Nmap scans directly from the web interface.
- Enable users to input custom Nmap commands, select scan options, and view results in real-time.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- Node.js
